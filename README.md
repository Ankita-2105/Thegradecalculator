# Thegradecalculator
# A robust Python command-line utility for calculating final course grades using weighted averages across three fixed categories. Features reliable input validation, error handling (`try-except`), and accurate letter grade assignment. Demonstrates core functions and control flow.
## Its primary function is to automate the calculation of a student's final course percentage and corresponding letter grade based on a weighted average of the core assessment categories (Homework, Midterm, and Final Exam). This project demonstrates the practical application of essential programming principles, particularly functional decomposition, robust error handling (using try-except blocks), and conditional logic (if-elif-else) to ensure an accurate and reliable result.
# This project runs on only python codes.
## The python version used in this is python 3.13.

## Conclusion & Future Direction:
# The Grade Calculator successfully met all defined functional and non-functional requirements, serving as a reliable and practical tool for grade calculation while demonstrating mastery of Python fundamentals like modularity and exception handling. This foundational structure is highly extensible, with future enhancements planned to include support for dynamic, user-defined grading categories and data persistence to save grading schemes for later use.
